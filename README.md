## Description

This module lets you manage the configuration of systemd, its various daemons and perhaps most importantly, the nifty things you can via systemd units.

## Limitations

Tested on modern Fedora and CentOS releases, but likely to work on any Red Hat variant.  Adaptations for other operating systems should be trivial as this module follows the data-in-module paradigm.  See `data/common.yaml` for the most likely obstructions.  If "one size can't fit all", the value should be moved from `data/common.yaml` to `data/os/%{facts.os.name}.yaml` instead.  See `hiera.yaml` for how this is handled.

This should be compatible with Puppet 3.x and is being used with Puppet 4.x as
well.

## Development

Contributions are welcome via pull requests.  All code should generally be compliant with puppet-lint.
